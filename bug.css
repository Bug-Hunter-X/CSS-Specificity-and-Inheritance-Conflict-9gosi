The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is more specific, but unexpectedly, the text is still blue */
}
```

The expected behavior is that the text within a `<p>` element nested inside a `<div>` should be green due to the higher specificity of `div p`.  However, if the `<p>` element is styled elsewhere, like in the second rule with `color:red;`, then the browser may apply this rule before the more specific rule `div p`, resulting in blue text.

This demonstrates a quirk of CSS inheritance and specificity where a less specific selector with later declaration can sometimes override a more specific one if it targets the same inherited property.
