The solution involves adjusting the order of CSS rules or increasing the specificity of the intended rule to ensure it takes precedence. Here are two approaches:

**Approach 1:  Increase Specificity**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div > p {
  color: green; /* Using the child selector `>` increases specificity */
}
```

This approach makes `div > p` more specific by ensuring that the `<p>` element is a direct child of the `<div>`.

**Approach 2: Rule Ordering (Less Reliable):**

Though less reliable, declaring the `div p` rule *before* the `p` rule can sometimes achieve the intended result.  However, this approach is fragile and less maintainable:

```css
div p {
  color: green;
}

div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

It's generally recommended to prefer Approach 1 (increasing specificity) to ensure predictable and maintainable CSS.
